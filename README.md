# **Module4-School_District_Analysis**
# **Module 4 PyCitySchools with Pandas**

## **Project Overview**

### The purpose of this analysis is to investigate suspected academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered.  The task is to replace the inaccurate data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School while keeping the rest of the data intact and perform the same analysis we did in our module.

### The steps to to conduct this analysis are as follows:

###     1. Replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
###     2. Repeat the school district analysis and recreate the following metrics:
####       - The district summary
####       - The school summary
####       - The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
####       - The average math score for each grade level from each school
####       - The average reading score for each grade level from each school
####       - The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type.
###     3. Describe how these changes affect the overall analysis.

### The district summary was barely affected by the correction made:
### - The average Math Score decreased by 0.1% to 78.9%.
### - The % Passing Math decreased by 0.2% to 74.8%.
### - The average Reading Score did not change.
### - The % Passing Reading decreased by 0.1% to 85.7%.
### - The % Overall Passing decreased by 0.3% to 64.9%.

### **How is the school summary affected?**



### **How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**

### **How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
### - Math and reading scores by grade
### - Scores by school spending
### - Scores by school size
### - Scores by school type
